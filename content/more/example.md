As seen above, setting front matter options will create features on the page:

- `topics:` will appear as a small feature below the title (optional). 
- `description:` will appear as an indented text block below the title (optional). This gives you a chance to summarize the section contents. 
- `youtubeid:` will add an YouTube video embed (optional). Find the id in the YouTube link. For example, in `https://youtu.be/moJgWrD6dwg` or `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJgWrD6dwg` the youtubeid is `moJgWrD6dwg`.
